Finance-OFX-Parse-Simple

This module provides simple parsing of OFX files, either by filename
or directly as scalars.

Note that this module is primarily intended for the OFX files from
bank statements rather than credit card statements. Any patches to
make this module fully-compliant with the credit card statement style
of OFX files would be gratefully received.
